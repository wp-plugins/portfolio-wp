This portfolio plugin will provide you 2 stylish full screen project viewers/explorers with thumbnail scrollers and 5 quck popup viewers.

With this portfolio plugin you'll be able to show project titles, descriptions or hover buttons within a overlays. Also you can either link the portfolio item to it's origin as en external hyperlink or enable embedded viewers to let your customers without moving away explore your portfolio projects. Career Portfolio supports category filtration. It's super easy to assign a category to each portfolio item. Without separately adding project categories, you can just add a comma separated tags ( categories ), like you're entering different email recipients on your mail client. Career Portfolio plugin will make your portfolio social by one click. Just chose social buttons enabled hover styles and your customers will be able share your portfolio projects ( via Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or Pinterest ). The plugin shows a loading progress on front to prevent potential confusions when the portfolio contains lots of projects and images and the loading can take a while. The next important feature that Career Portfolio plugin provides is an embedded elegant full screen project viewers. Instead of showing your portfolio project details only within a popup viewer, like almost all the other plugins do, this portfolio plugin also provides full screen viewers, where your customers can find detailed information regarding your porfolio items. The plugin's FS viewers will show thumbnail scroller at bottom side and will show portfolio project images within a slider, where you can navigate back and forth. This portfolio plugin supports well known Colorbox 5 styles too. You just need to put a preference in the options section and the portfolio related projects will be shown withing a popup instead of FS viewers. Career Portfolio provides very simple and user friendly admin portfolio composer where you can create a portfolio and customize lots of portfolio related options. This portfolio plugin supports almost full design customization options. If the available options are not enough to fully customize your portfolio's look to fit your needs, no problem, there is a possibility to write a native custom CSS & JS. If you a little bit know either CSS or JS you will easily customize it. Career Portfolio also supports short-codes, which aims to embed a portfolio on any page by one click.
